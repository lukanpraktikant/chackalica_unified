"""Canonical chachak pipeline vocabulary for the Django app.

Both :class:`training.models.Experiment` (the train/eval pipeline attached to an
experiment) and :class:`eval_pipelines.models.PipelineEvalRun` (a standalone
pipeline eval) reference these constants, so the choices live in exactly one
place.

Keep in sync with ``chachak.config.PIPELINE_NAMES`` — we can't import chachak
here (its package pulls in torch, absent in the app env), so this list is a
hand-maintained mirror.
